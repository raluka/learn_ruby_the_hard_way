Exercise 6: Strings and Text

While you have been writing strings, you still do not know what they do. In this exercise we create a bunch of variables
with complex strings so you can see what they are for. First an explanation of strings.

A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone, or "export" out of the program you are writing. Ruby
knows you want something to be a string when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text.
You saw this many times with your use of puts when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside " after
the puts to print the string.

Strings can contain any number of variables that are in your Ruby script. Remember that a variable is any line of code
where you set a name = (equal) to a value. In the code for this exercise, types_of_people = 10 creates a variable named
types_of_people and sets it = (equal) to 10. You can put that in any string with #{types_of_people}.

=end

types_of_people = 10
x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."

puts x
puts y

puts "I said: #{x}."
puts "I also said: '#{y}'."

hilarious = false
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"

puts joke_evaluation

w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

puts w + e
