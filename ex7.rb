Exercise 7: More Printing

Now we are going to do a bunch of exercises where you just type code in and make it run. I won't be explaining this
exercise because it is more of the same. The purpose is to build up your chops.

=end

puts "Mary has a little lamb."
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
puts "." * 10 # prints 10 dots

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# puts add a new line after executing
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
