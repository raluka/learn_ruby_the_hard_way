ExExercise 10: What Was That?

In Exercise 9 I threw you some new stuff, just to keep you on your toes. I showed you two ways to make a string that
goes across multiple lines. In the first way, I put the characters \n (backslash n) between the names of the months.
These two characters put a new line character into the string at that point.

This \ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string. There are various "escape sequences"
available for different characters you might want to use. We'll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I mean.

An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote ' or double-quote ". Imagine you have a string that uses
double-quotes and you want to put a double-quote inside the string. If you write "I "understand" joe." then Ruby will
get confused because it will think the " around "understand" actually ends the string. You need a way to tell Ruby that
the " inside the string isn't a real double-quote.

To solve this problem you escape double-quotes and single-quotes so Ruby knows to include in the string.
Here's an example:

"I am 6'2\" tall."  # escape double-quote inside string
'I am 6\'2" tall.'  # escape single-quote inside string
The second way is by using triple-quotes, which is just """ and works like a string, but you also can put as many
lines of text as you want until you type """ again. We'll also play with these.
