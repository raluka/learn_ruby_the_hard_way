Exercise 8: Printing, Printing

I will now show you how to create a format string, but rather than using variables, use values by their names.
Some of this is a bit more advanced, but don't worry you'll learn what all of these mean later. Just type this in,
make it work, and write a comment above each line translating it to English.

formatter = "%{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth}"

puts formatter % { first: 1, second: 2, third: 3, fourth: 4 }
puts formatter % { first: "one", second: "two", third: "three", fourth: "four" }
puts formatter % { first: true, second: false, third: true, fourth: false }
puts formatter % { first: formatter, second: formatter, third: formatter, fourth: formatter }

puts formatter % {
         first: "I had this thing.",
         second: "That you could type up right.",
         third: "But I didn't sing.",
         fourth: "So I said goodnight."
     }
